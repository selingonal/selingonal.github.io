									<h2>Intro</h2>
									<p>
										I'm a student living in Washington D.C and I'm really passionate about making the world a better place. 
										Subject areas I'm interested in within Computer Science inlcude Embedded Systems and Machine Learning, but other than that I also really like to study things like History and Languages.

									<h2>Technical Coursework:</h2>
									<p>
										Here's a list of all the technical coursework I've taken to date, and some skills I've picked up from them:

										Fall 2017:
											Computer Science Orientation: This class was an 8-week orientation to get us used to the school's department, our final project was actually to build a LeJOS robot that could autonomously navigate a maze. 
											
											Introduction to Software Development: This class was an introduction to programming in Java, we learned about basic concepts of programming and tested out our programs audibly with a software called JMusic.

										Spring 2018: 
											Algorithms and Data Structutes: Another course that was taught in Java, in this class we learned a lot about different data structure and object orientation. One of the biggest skills I gained from this class was a sense as to how to make my programs more efficient. 

											Discrete Mathematics I: The outcome of this course was to help us learn to formulate problems in  mathematical terms and concepts such as functions, relations, graphs,trees, and Boolean logic, which are conducive to methodical problem-solving. I learned a lot on how to approach problems logically, and how to formulate mathematical proofs.

										Fall 2018: 
											Computer Architecture: This is an introductory course on computer organization and computer systems. 

											Software Engineering: 

											Discrete Mathematics II:
